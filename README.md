### Repository structure

```
NemaCode/
├─ data/            # Seurat objects and data files needed for the analysis
├─ scripts/         # Reusable R scripts (functions, themes, helpers)
├─ notebooks/       # RMarkdown notebooks reproducing all analyses and figures
│   ├─ ...

└─ sessioninfo/     # Global R session info and package versions
```

- **data/**  
  Seurat objects are not available due to size constrains.  
  See *Data availability* below.

- **scripts/**  
  R scripts with helper functions used across notebooks.

- **notebooks/**  
  R Markdown notebook with figures inline.
  
  `.Rmd` files contain the source code.
  
  `.md` files are the rendered versions for easier viewing on GitHub.

- **sessioninfo/**  
  Contains a global `session_info.txt` and each notebook ends with  
  `sessioninfo::session_info()` for reproducibility.

### Data availability

**Important:** Raw and processed single-cell RNA-seq data are **not included** in this GitHub repository.

- All data will be released on **NCBI GEO** under accession number.  
- After public release, download the files and place them in `data/seurat_objects/` to run the notebooks.

---

### Reproducing the analyses

1. Clone or download this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/teima90/NemaCode.git
   ```
2. Download the raw data (when publicly available) and put them under `data/seurat_objects/`.
3. Open the RStudio project (`NemaCode.Rproj`).
4. Run the notebooks in order.

All figures in the paper can be regenerated by knitting these notebooks.

### Software requirements

- **R ≥ 4.2.1**
- Required R packages are listed at the end of each notebook and in  
  `sessioninfo/session_info.txt`.
