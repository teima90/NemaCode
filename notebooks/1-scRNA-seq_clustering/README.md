# Analysis of Arabidopsis and rice scRNA-seq data

The notebooks contain the code to analyze the merged datasets of RKN infected and mock roots in *Oryza sativa* and *Arabidopsis thaliana*

## 01_Metrics_and_clustering

Metrics of the datasets, decision in clustering resolution and calculation of marker genes per cluster.

## 02_Clustering_robustness

Evaluation of batch effects from biological replicates and cell number imbalance between mock and infected samples in clustering.

## 03_Nematode_clusters

Selection of clusters enriched in cells from the infected samples. Evaluation of expression of known nematode responsive genes and comparison with bulk RNA-seq data.
